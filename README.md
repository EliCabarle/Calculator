# Calculator

Calculator - something used for making mathematical calculations, in particular a small electronic device with a keyboard and a visual display.
           - this is a simple project to make a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator application using a wxWidgets Framework for C++ application development

Features:
           - a simple layout for just simple calculations
           - a stack data structure was used for the implementation of concurrent mathematic or arithmetic operations, i.e. (2+3-4), pressing "=" would equate to 1
           - the generation of buttons implemented a use of a "for loop" with each identifying a specific id and label for the digits, operations, and reversal of the digits sign.

Recommendations:
           - adaptive layout for the buttons to change in size whenever the panel changes ratio
           - to make an executable for the calculator itself, so that the user does not have to run the code to an IDE for using the calculator.
